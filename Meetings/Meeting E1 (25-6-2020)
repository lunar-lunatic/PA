Motion E1-1: Revoking and reorganising Motion 12-3 into 13-2: "The end island to be leveled to y59 and cover it with end stone slabs, people can't dig lower than y60 and build on the end island as long as it stays spawn proofed. Before this can happen all the gateways are to be opened and announcements are to be made before the fights in order for people to join in"
